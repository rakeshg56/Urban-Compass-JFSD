# Urban-Compass-Smart-City-Guide

## Description
In today's dynamic world, cities attract diverse populations seeking opportunities or a better lifestyle. However, newcomers/visitors often struggle to navigate the city's facilities and services. So Urban Compass - Smart City Project addresses this by offering an integrated web platform providing essential information for newcomers to explore a city effectively. The application will provide people every basic information that one needs in a new city.

## Modules 
- ***User***: User is the one who is new to the city or want to explore all the services that a particular city has. Users can register and log in to explore a city of their choice. The user can access basic information, navigate services through the navbar, and make hotel or rental bookings and can track the same. If any issues arise or incorrect information is found, users can contact the admin through a form. Users can also access an interactive chatbot to get any information related to the city.

+ ***Admin***: Admin is responsible for verifying user registrations, approving/rejecting users. Most importantly the Admin is the one who will add a new city for the users to explore. Responsible for adding all the information related to the city. The Admin manages all city-related information, updates existing data. The admin can validate and respond to user queries and feedback.
